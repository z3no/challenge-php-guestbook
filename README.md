# PHP Guestbook
Consolidation Challenge

****

## Learning objectives
***

- Storing data in files
- Converting complex constructs (array/objects) to string representation.
- Deliver a project under a strict deadline

## Our Mission
*** 

It is time for our first php Consolidation challenge! Let's remember the internet of the 1990, and create a classic widget that every site in that decade had: a _**guestbook**_.
Any visitor on te page can leave a message on your page that are then saved and showed (last message on top) for everybody who visits the page.

#### How to store the messages?

You can store the messages in a file on your system. You can use the brother of [file_get_contents()](https://php.net/file_get_contents) for this: [file_put_contents()](https://php.net/file_put_contents) .
You can either use [json_encode()](https://php.net/json_encode) or [serialize()](https://php.net/serialize) to convert your array to a string to store.

## Must-have features
- Posts must have the following attributes:
  - [ ] Title
  - [ ] Date
  - [ ] Content
  - [ ] Author name

- [ ] Use at least 2 classes: PostLoader & Post
- [ ] The messages are sorted from new (top) to old (bottom).
- [ ] Make sure the script can handle [site defacement attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_defacement): use [htmlspecialchars()](https://www.php.net/htmlspecialchars)
- [ ] Only show the latest 20 posts.

## Nice to have features

- [ ] Profanity filter: at the top of your script create an array of "bad" words. If somebody tries to enter a message with those words, their messages gets rejected.

- [ ] When the user enters uses a "smily" like ":-)", ";-)", ":-(" replace it with an image of such a smily.

- [ ] Have an input field where the user can enter how many message he wants to see displayed.

### Tips & Advice

- To keep a good overview of the code we recommend separating the view (html code) as much as possible from the PHP code.
  If you want you can already look into [more advanced theory](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller-model) for this separation, but it is not required in this exercise.
- Write your footer and header HTML code and `require()` them in your template files in separate files to avoid repeating HTML code.
